# Testing OAuth Without Database

I've temporarily disabled the Prisma adapter to test if Google OAuth works.

## What I Changed:

- Commented out `adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma)` in the NextAuth config
- This means authentication will work with JWT only (no database writes)
- Once we confirm OAuth works, we'll re-enable the adapter

## Next Steps:

1. **Restart your dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Try Google Login:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Click the Google button
   - Complete Google authentication
3. **Watch the Terminal:**
   You should see detailed logs:
   ```
   [SignIn Callback] Triggered
   [SignIn Callback] Provider: google
   [SignIn Callback] User email: your@email.com
   [SignIn Callback] SUCCESS: Allowing sign in
   ```

## Expected Outcome:

✅ **If it works:** You should be redirected to `/room` and logged in

- This means OAuth is configured correctly
- We just need to sync the database schema

❌ **If it still fails:**

- Check the terminal for error messages
- The issue is with Google Console configuration

## After Testing:

Once OAuth works, we'll:

1. Stop the dev server
2. Run `npx prisma db push` (may need to close VS Code first)
3. Re-enable the Prisma adapter
4. Restart and test again with database storage

## Why This Test?

The error was likely because:

- Prisma adapter tries to write to database tables
- Those tables don't exist yet (schema not synced)
- By removing adapter temporarily, we can test OAuth in isolation
